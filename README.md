[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fhirbase/fhirbase.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fhirbase/fhirbase)

Fhirbase is a command-line utility which enables you to easily import
[FHIR data](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) into a PostgreSQL database and
work with it in a relational way. Also Fhirbase provides set of stored
procedures to perform [CRUD
operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)
and maintain [Resources
History](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html#history).

## Getting Started

Please proceed to the [Getting
Started](https://fhirbase.aidbox.app/getting-started) tutorial
for PostgreSQL and Fhirbase installation instructions.

## Usage Statistics

Please note that Fhirbase collects anonymous usage statistics. It does
not send any FHIR data, only events happened (database initialized,
resources imported and error happened). You can check the [source code
for stats
sender](https://github.com/fhirbase/fhirbase/blob/master/stats.go)
yourself.

You can turn off usage statistics sending with `--nostats` global
flag.

## Development

To participate in Fhirbase development you'll need to install Golang.

Fhirbase is Makefile-based project, so building it is as simple as
invoking `make` command.

NB you can put Fhirbase source code outside of `GOPATH` env variable
because Makefile sets `GOPATH` value to `fhirbase-root/.gopath`.

To enable hot reload of demo's static assets set `DEV` env variable
like this:

```
DEV=1 fhirbase web
```
